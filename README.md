# SecureMyAccount

Visit the plugin page [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/securemyaccount/).

Inspired by GitHub and Google, here is a Bukkit plugin to use two factor authentication. Your Mojang/Minecraft
account is protected by a single password or login token. What happens if your account gets stolen? Therefore this
plugin exists.

The password is time based and generated by your smartphone completely independent from your Mojang account and your
computer. This process is also known as 2FA.
